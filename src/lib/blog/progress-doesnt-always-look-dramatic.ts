We often expect progress to feel exciting.

In reality, most progress is quiet:
small decisions,
daily consistency,
long timelines.

A calm wallpaper reflects this truth.

It doesn’t celebrate prematurely.
It doesn’t rush outcomes.

It simply stays with you while progress happens in the background.

Not all growth needs applause.`
