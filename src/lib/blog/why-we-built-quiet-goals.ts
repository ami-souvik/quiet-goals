    content: `# Why We Built Quiet Goals

We didn’t want to build another productivity app.

There are already thousands:
apps that track,
apps that gamify,
apps that notify.

What we wanted didn’t exist.

We wanted a way to keep one important goal present without turning it into noise.

No feeds.
No comparisons.
No streak pressure.

Just a single milestone, translated into something calm and visual.

Quiet Goals was born from the belief that focus doesn’t come from doing more —
it comes from remembering what matters.

This is not motivation software.
It’s a small, intentional space for your future self.`
