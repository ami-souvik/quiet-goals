You don’t need another habit.

You already have one:
checking your phone.

Instead of asking you to build new behaviors, Quiet Goals works with what already exists.

Every unlock becomes a micro-reminder.
No effort required.
No discipline needed.

This is not habit-building.
It’s habit-alignment.

Your environment shapes your behavior.
Your wallpaper is part of that environment.`
