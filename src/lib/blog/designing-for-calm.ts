    content: `# Designing for Calm in a Noisy World

Most digital products compete for attention.

They use color, movement, and urgency to keep you engaged.

Quiet Goals does the opposite.

We design for:
soft contrast,
gentle typography,
minimal presence.

Calm is not accidental.
It’s a design choice.

When a milestone is presented without visual noise, it becomes easier to live with. It doesn’t demand action — it invites alignment.

In a noisy world, calm is a feature.`
