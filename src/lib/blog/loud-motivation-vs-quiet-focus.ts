    content: `# Loud Motivation vs Quiet Focus

Motivation today is loud.

Push notifications.
Daily streaks.
Quotes screaming urgency.

But loud motivation fades quickly.

Quiet focus, on the other hand, stays.

A calm reminder doesn’t push you.
It doesn’t shame you.
It simply exists in your environment.

Quiet Goals is built on this principle:
goals don’t need to shout to matter.

A single milestone, placed thoughtfully on your wallpaper, becomes part of your mental background. Over time, it subtly influences decisions, priorities, and patience.

The goal isn’t intensity.
The goal is consistency.

Quiet focus wins.`
