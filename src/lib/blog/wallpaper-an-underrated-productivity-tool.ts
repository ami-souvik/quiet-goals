    content: `# Why Your Wallpaper Is the Most Underrated Productivity Tool

Most productivity tools ask for your attention.

Your wallpaper already has it.

You unlock your phone dozens of times a day. It’s the most frequently seen screen in your life, yet we usually fill it with random photos, abstract art, or nothing meaningful at all.

A wallpaper doesn’t interrupt you.
It doesn’t notify you.
It doesn’t demand action.

That’s exactly why it works.

When a single, personal milestone lives quietly on your screen, it reinforces intent without effort. No motivation spikes. No guilt. Just presence.

Quiet Goals exists around this idea:
what you see every day shapes what you become.

Sometimes, the most powerful reminder is the one that never asks for attention.`
