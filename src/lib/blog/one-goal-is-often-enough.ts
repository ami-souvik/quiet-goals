    content: `# One Goal Is Often Enough

We’re taught to juggle many goals at once.

In reality, most meaningful progress happens when one thing leads.

One goal clarifies decisions.
One goal simplifies priorities.
One goal removes noise.

Quiet Goals is intentionally limited to a single milestone.

Not because you don’t have more goals —
but because focus works best when it’s narrow.

Your wallpaper shouldn’t be a to-do list.
It should be a reminder.

One thing.
Seen every day.
Quietly working in the background.`
